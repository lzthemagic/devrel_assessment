# Developer Relations Engineer Assessment

This challenge was an exciting deep dive into understanding how Smart Contracts work on Algorand. At first, it seemed like a straightforward task, but as I explored further, I realized the depth and complexity of the abstractions provided by Algokit. The learning process was rewarding!

## 📌 Key Learnings

Here are the main concepts I mastered throughout this challenge:

| Topic                           | Key Takeaways |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| **Development Environment**     | Setting up and running the local sandbox. |
| **Sandbox Communication**       | Understanding how different resources interact. |
| **Algorand Core Concepts**      | Applications, Accounts, Assets, Transactions, and Wallets. |
| **Smart Contracts**             | Writing, testing, and deploying contracts with defined rules. |
| **Algokit**                     | Exploring benefits, constraints, and best practices. |
| **Lora & Goal CLI**             | Usage across LocalNet, TestNet, and MainNet. |
| **Smart Contract Testing**      | Writing test cases with `pytest` to validate execution. |
| **Deployment Strategies**       | Cost calculation, deployment, and execution flow analysis. |
| **Blockchain Workflow**         | End-to-end understanding of how contracts operate. |

Beyond these structured learnings, I also explored how to work with Boxes without relying on Algopy’s abstractions. I wanted to understand how to "manually" configure their creation and manage values, diving deeper into the mechanics of how storage works at a lower level. This gave me more control over execution and a better appreciation of the complexity behind these structures. For developers looking for more flexibility and customization, this approach is definitely worth experimenting with.

## 🔁 Learning Pathway

Below is a structured flowchart representing my learning journey through this challenge:

```
[Setup Sandbox] --> [Explore Algorand Concepts] --> [Develop Smart Contracts] --> [Test with Pytest] \
   |                                                           |                                    /
   |                                                           v                                   /
   |--> [Deploy on LocalNet] --> [Deploy on TestNet] --> [Analyze Costs & Optimization] --> [Refine & Iterate]
```

##  Final Thoughts
During development, I extensively explored **official documentation, articles, guides, and discussions on Discord**. While I gained a solid understanding, I identified some **areas for improvement** that could make the learning process more intuitive for developers.

I'll be submitting a separate document with detailed feedback along with the repository link. I also recognize that **documentation updates are already in progress**, so many of these points might be addressed soon.

This challenge was more than a technical exercise, it was an opportunity to experience how simple is to create smart contracts using algokit and to understand a lot more about how everything works. I enjoyed exploring the platform, pushing the boundaries of the available tools, and identifying areas for improvement.
